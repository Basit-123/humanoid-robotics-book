# Physical AI, Humanoid Robotics, and Agentic Engineering

## Course Overview

Welcome to **Physical AI, Humanoid Robotics, and Agentic Engineering** — a comprehensive exploration of embodied intelligence systems. This course bridges the gap between artificial intelligence and physical reality, focusing on the design, control, and deployment of humanoid robots capable of operating autonomously in human environments.

### What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that interact with and learn from the physical world through embodied agents. Unlike purely digital AI systems, physical AI must contend with:

- **Real-world physics**: Gravity, friction, momentum, and material constraints
- **Sensor uncertainty**: Noisy, partial, and delayed observations
- **Actuator limitations**: Finite force, torque, bandwidth, and precision
- **Safety-critical operations**: Failure can cause physical harm
- **Human interaction**: Natural, intuitive, and socially appropriate behaviors

### Why Humanoid Robots?

Humanoid robots—robots with human-like form and capabilities—represent a particularly challenging and valuable frontier in physical AI:

1. **Human-centered environments**: Our built world is designed for human morphology
2. **Tool compatibility**: Use existing tools without redesign
3. **Social interaction**: Humans naturally understand and trust humanoid forms
4. **General-purpose capabilities**: Adaptable to diverse tasks and settings
5. **Benchmark for intelligence**: Human-level embodied intelligence as a grand challenge

## Course Structure

This course is organized as a **4-quarter sequence** covering 12 modules:

### Quarter 1: Foundations (Modules 1–3)
Establish the historical context, biological inspiration, and core abstractions necessary for understanding embodied intelligence.

### Quarter 2: Kinematics & Dynamics (Modules 4–6)
Master the mathematics and physics of humanoid motion, from forward/inverse kinematics to balance and locomotion.

### Quarter 3: Control, Perception & Learning (Modules 7–9)
Explore how humanoids sense their environment, plan and execute whole-body motions, and learn physical skills through experience.

### Quarter 4: Systems, HRI & Capstone (Modules 10–12)
Integrate knowledge into full-stack systems, address human-robot interaction and safety, and complete a comprehensive capstone project.

## Target Audience

This course is designed for:

- **Senior undergraduate students** in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, or Robotics
- **Early graduate students** seeking foundational knowledge in physical AI and humanoid robotics
- **Practitioners and researchers** looking to understand embodied intelligence systems
- **AI enthusiasts** with strong technical backgrounds interested in physical systems

## Prerequisites

To succeed in this course, you should have:

**Mathematics:**
- Linear algebra (vectors, matrices, transformations)
- Multivariable calculus (gradients, Jacobians, optimization)
- Probability and statistics (distributions, Bayes' theorem)

**Physics:**
- Classical mechanics (forces, torques, energy)
- Lagrangian/Hamiltonian mechanics (helpful but not required)

**Programming:**
- Python programming (intermediate level)
- NumPy/PyTorch basics
- Data structures and algorithms

**AI/ML:**
- Introductory machine learning (supervised learning, neural networks)
- Reinforcement learning is introduced in the course—no prior experience required

## Learning Philosophy

This course emphasizes:

1. **First principles**: Understand the "why" before the "how"
2. **Hands-on practice**: Implement concepts in simulators and (optionally) hardware
3. **Rigor with accessibility**: Mathematical precision without losing intuition
4. **Open-source tools**: All examples use free, open-source software
5. **Progressive complexity**: Build knowledge incrementally from foundations to advanced topics

## Tools and Software

All course materials use **free and open-source tools**:

- **Simulation**: PyBullet, MuJoCo (free version), Isaac Gym/Sim (free tier)
- **Frameworks**: ROS 2 (Robot Operating System)
- **ML Libraries**: PyTorch, NumPy, SciPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Plotly, MeshCat

No proprietary software or expensive hardware is required to complete the course.

## Course Format

Each module includes:

- **Conceptual overview**: Motivation and key ideas
- **Technical content**: Mathematical foundations and algorithms
- **Practical activities**: Coding exercises and simulations
- **Assessments**: Problem sets, projects, and reflections
- **Resources**: Further reading, videos, and open-source repositories

## Time Commitment

- **Lecture/reading**: 3-4 hours per week per module
- **Hands-on activities**: 4-6 hours per week per module
- **Assessments**: Variable (2-10 hours depending on module)
- **Total per module**: ~10-15 hours
- **Full course**: ~150-180 hours over 12 modules
