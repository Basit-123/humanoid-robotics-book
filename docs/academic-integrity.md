# Academic Integrity & Collaboration Policy

Academic integrity is fundamental to learning. This policy clarifies expectations for collaboration, use of resources, and ethical conduct throughout the course.

## Core Principles

1. **Honesty**: Submit work that is genuinely your own or properly attributed
2. **Responsibility**: Understand and follow collaboration guidelines for each assignment
3. **Respect**: Honor the learning process for yourself and your peers
4. **Transparency**: Disclose all collaborations, resources, and AI tool usage

Violations undermine learning and will be addressed seriously according to institutional academic misconduct policies.

## What Constitutes Academic Dishonesty?

### Prohibited Actions

**Plagiarism**:
- Copying solutions from peers, online sources, or previous course instances
- Paraphrasing others' work without attribution
- Submitting work that is not substantially your own

**Unauthorized Collaboration**:
- Sharing code or written solutions for individual assignments
- Dividing work on individual assignments among multiple students
- Accessing or using another student's code or write-up

**Misuse of AI Tools**:
- Using code generation tools (ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, etc.) without disclosure
- Submitting AI-generated content without demonstrating understanding
- Relying on AI tools for work you claim as your original reasoning

**Misrepresentation**:
- Falsifying experimental results or data
- Claiming credit for work done by others (including in team projects)
- Submitting the same work for multiple courses without permission

**Unauthorized Resources**:
- Using solution manuals, homework answers, or exam keys from previous years
- Accessing restricted materials (exam questions, grading rubrics not provided to students)

---

## What IS Allowed?

### Encouraged Collaboration

**For All Assignments**:
- Discussing concepts and approaches at a high level
- Asking clarifying questions about assignment requirements
- Helping peers debug by discussing strategies (not writing code for them)
- Studying together and explaining course material to each other

**For Problem Sets**:
- Discussing problem-solving approaches before writing solutions
- Checking answers after independent work to identify errors
- **Must write up solutions independently in your own words**

**For Coding Projects** (unless specified as individual work):
- Pair programming with your designated partner
- Discussing algorithms and implementation strategies
- Sharing resources (tutorials, documentation, Stack Overflow posts)
- **Must write and understand all submitted code**

**For Team Projects**:
- Full collaboration within your team
- Dividing work equitably with clear documentation of contributions
- **All team members must understand the complete project**

---

## Use of External Resources

### Acceptable Resource Use

**Online Resources**:
- Course textbooks, papers, and recommended readings
- Official documentation (Python, PyTorch, ROS 2, etc.)
- General tutorials and Stack Overflow for syntax and library usage
- Academic papers for background and related work

**Attribution Required**:
- Cite sources in code comments (e.g., `# Algorithm from [Smith et al. 2023]`)
- Include references section in written work
- Acknowledge peers who provided substantial help

### AI Tools Policy

**Permitted with Disclosure**:
- Using AI tools (ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.) for brainstorming, debugging, or learning
- **You must disclose AI tool usage** in a dedicated statement:
  - What tool was used and for what purpose
  - How you validated and understood the generated content
  - What you modified or learned

**Example disclosure**:
> "I used ChatGPT to generate an initial implementation of the inverse kinematics solver. I then debugged and modified the code to handle singularities correctly, validated it against analytical solutions, and ensured I understand each step of the algorithm."

**Not Acceptable**:
- Copy-pasting AI-generated solutions without modification or understanding
- Using AI to complete substantial portions of assignments without learning
- Failing to disclose AI tool usage

**Rationale**: AI tools are powerful learning aids when used responsibly. We want you to learn how to use them effectively while ensuring you develop genuine understanding.

## Collaboration Guidelines by Assignment Type

| Assignment Type | Collaboration Level | Submission |
|----------------|---------------------|------------|
| Problem Sets | Discuss approaches; write up independently | Individual |
| Coding Projects (Individual) | Discuss strategies; write code independently | Individual |
| Coding Projects (Pairs) | Full collaboration with partner | Team (2 students) |
| Design Challenges | Independent work | Individual |
| Capstone Proposal | Team discussion; write collaboratively | Team (1-3 students) |
| Capstone Implementation | Full team collaboration | Team |
| Capstone Report | Team writing with individual contribution documentation | Team |

## How to Collaborate Ethically

### The "Whiteboard Test"

After collaborating with peers:
1. Close all shared materials (notes, code, whiteboards)
2. Wait 30 minutes
3. Write your solution from memory

If you can't reproduce the solution independently, you collaborated too closely.

### Giving and Receiving Help

**When helping others**:
- Explain concepts; don't provide solutions
- Ask guiding questions rather than giving answers
- Suggest resources rather than writing code

**When receiving help**:
- Seek to understand, not just to obtain the answer
- Try independently first; seek help when stuck
- Acknowledge substantive help in your submission

---

## Self-Checks for Academic Integrity

Before submitting any work, ask yourself:

1. ✅ **Can I explain this work to the instructor without notes?**
2. ✅ **Did I write/create all submitted content (or properly attribute sources)?**
3. ✅ **Did I follow the collaboration guidelines for this assignment?**
4. ✅ **Have I disclosed all AI tool usage and external resources?**
5. ✅ **Would I be comfortable with this work being reviewed by peers?**

If you answer "no" to any question, revise your work before submitting.

---

## Reporting Academic Misconduct

### If You Witness Misconduct

- **Notify the instructor confidentially** via email or office hours
- Provide specific details (who, what, when, evidence)
- Reports are kept confidential; no retaliation will be tolerated

### If You Are Unsure About a Situation

- **Ask before submitting**: "Would it be acceptable to...?"
- Use office hours or email to clarify gray areas
- It's always better to ask than to risk a violation

---

## Consequences of Violations

Academic integrity violations are taken seriously. Consequences depend on severity and intent:

### First Offense (Minor)
- Zero on the assignment
- Required meeting with instructor
- Educational intervention (reflection assignment, academic integrity workshop)
- No notation on transcript

### Serious or Repeated Violations
- Failure in the course
- Report to academic affairs/dean
- Possible notation on transcript
- Potential suspension or expulsion (per institutional policy)

**Aggravating factors** (increase severity):
- Premeditation or organized cheating
- Repeated violations
- Refusal to acknowledge or learn from mistake

**Mitigating factors** (may reduce severity):
- Self-reporting before discovery
- Genuine misunderstanding of policy (first-time)
- Demonstrated learning and accountability

---

## Due Process

If accused of academic misconduct:

1. **Notification**: Instructor will contact you with specific allegations
2. **Meeting**: You will have an opportunity to respond and present your perspective
3. **Evidence Review**: Instructor will consider all evidence fairly
4. **Decision**: Instructor will determine if a violation occurred and appropriate consequences
5. **Appeal**: You may appeal the decision per institutional procedures

You are presumed not responsible until evidence demonstrates otherwise.

---

## Special Circumstances

### Extensions and Late Work

- **Grace period**: 24-hour automatic extension (no penalty, no approval needed)
- **Emergencies**: Contact instructor as soon as possible for accommodations
- **Do not fabricate emergencies**: This is itself an integrity violation

### Collaborative vs. Competitive Environment

This course emphasizes **collaborative learning**:
- Your success does not depend on others' failure
- There is no grading curve
- Helping others learn benefits everyone

However, collaboration has limits (as defined above). The goal is for everyone to develop genuine competency.

---

## Cultural and Linguistic Considerations

### Non-Native English Speakers

- Using grammar checkers and editing tools is encouraged
- Peer review for language clarity is acceptable
- **Core ideas and technical content must be your own**

### Different Academic Cultures

Academic norms vary globally. If practices acceptable in your previous institution conflict with this policy:
- Ask for clarification
- Adapt to course expectations
- Seek support if you're unsure how to proceed

---

## Growth Mindset and Integrity

Academic integrity supports learning:

- **Struggle is valuable**: Difficulty means you're learning; shortcuts bypass growth
- **Mistakes are opportunities**: Errors reveal gaps to address, not flaws to hide
- **Understanding matters more than grades**: Deep learning leads to both

We trust you to engage authentically with the material and support your peers in doing the same.
