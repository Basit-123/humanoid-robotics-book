# Module 11: Human–Robot Interaction, Safety, and Social Intelligence

---

## Module Meta

**Module Number**: 11
**Quarter**: 4 (Systems, HRI & Capstone)
**Prerequisite**: Modules 1-10
**Estimated Time**: 14-16 hours
**Key Themes**: Human-Robot Interaction, Safety, Ethics, Social Cues, User Studies

---

## Module Overview

This module explores the critical interface between humans and humanoid robots. We will cover the principles of designing safe, intuitive, and effective interactions. Topics include understanding social cues, designing user studies, and ensuring robot behaviors are legible and predictable to humans.

**Why this matters for humanoids**: For humanoids to be accepted and effective in human environments, they must be able to interact with people in a way that is natural, safe, and socially intelligent.

---

## Module Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, learners will be able to:

1.  **Apply principles of HRI** to design intuitive robot behaviors.
2.  **Develop and implement safety protocols** for physical human-robot interaction.
3.  **Design and conduct user studies** to evaluate HRI effectiveness.
4.  **Incorporate social cues** (gaze, gesture, proxemics) into robot behaviors.
5.  **Analyze and critique HRI scenarios** from an ethical and social perspective.

---

## Topics and Subtopics

### 1. Fundamentals of HRI
- Proxemics: The social use of space
- Kinesics: Body language and gesture
- Gaze and joint attention
- Legibility and predictability of robot motion

**Why this matters for humanoids**: These are the foundational channels through which humans and robots communicate non-verbally.

### 2. Robot Safety
- Physical safety: Collision detection, soft robotics, compliant control
- Psychological safety: Avoiding the "uncanny valley," building trust
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- ISO safety standards for collaborative robots

**Why this matters for humanoids**: A single safety incident can erode public trust and set back the field for years. Safety is paramount.

### 3. User Study Design
- Within-subjects vs. between-subjects design
- Objective metrics (task time, success rate) and subjective metrics (questionnaires)
- Institutional Review Board (IRB) and ethical considerations
- Statistical analysis of HRI data

**Why this matters for humanoids**: Rigorous user studies are the only way to validate that an HRI design is actually effective.

### 4. Social Intelligence
- Theory of Mind in HRI
- Expressing emotion and intent
- Turn-taking in conversation
- Learning from demonstration and human feedback

**Why this matters for humanoids**: Social intelligence is the difference between a tool and a true collaborator.

## Teaching and Learning Activities

### 1. HRI Principles Workshop (3 hours)
Analyze videos of human-robot interactions and identify principles of good and bad design.

### 2. Safety Protocol Design (3 hours)
For a given humanoid task (e.g., handing over an object), design a multi-layered safety protocol.

### 3. User Study Mini-Project (4 hours)
Design a small user study to compare two different robot gestures for the same command.

### 4. Social Cue Implementation (3 hours)
Implement a simple gaze-following behavior on a simulated robot head.

## Assessment Requirements

### Summative
- **Problem Set 11**:
  - Analyze an HRI scenario and propose improvements.
  - Design a user study protocol.
- **Design Challenge 5**: Design the HRI for a humanoid assistant in a specific context (e.g., a library, a hospital).

## Assessment Rubric

| Criterion | Exemplary | Proficient | Developing | Inadequate |
|-----------|-----------|------------|------------|------------|
| **HRI Design** | Intuitive, safe, and effective | Reasonable design | Some flaws | Unusable |
| **Safety Analysis** | Comprehensive and rigorous | Adequate | Superficial | Missing |
| **User Study Design** | Valid and well-designed | Mostly correct | Significant flaws | Invalid |
| **Social Cues** | Nuanced and appropriate | Present | Awkward | Absent |

## Alignment and Progression Note

### Alignment
- **GLO 4**: Human-Robot Interaction
- **GLO 7**: Ethical and Social Responsibility

### Progression
This module builds on the systems from Module 10 and prepares for the final integration and ethical considerations in Module 12.
