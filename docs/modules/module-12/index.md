# Module 12: Building General-Purpose Humanoids: Integration, Ethics, and Capstone

---

## Module Meta

**Module Number**: 12
**Quarter**: 4 (Systems, HRI & Capstone)
**Prerequisite**: Modules 1-11
**Estimated Time**: 20-25 hours
**Key Themes**: Systems Integration, Capstone Project, Robotics Ethics, Long-Term Autonomy

---

## Module Overview

This final module synthesizes all the concepts from the previous eleven modules. Students will undertake a significant capstone project to design, and optionally simulate, a full-stack humanoid robot system for a general-purpose task. This module also delves into the profound ethical responsibilities of a robotics engineer and the societal impact of humanoid robots.

**Why this matters for humanoids**: This is the culmination of the entire course. It's where we transition from learning about individual components to understanding the holistic challenge of creating a complete, functional, and ethical humanoid robot.

---

## Module Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, learners will be able to:

1.  **Integrate** perception, control, and interaction into a cohesive system.
2.  **Manage a complex robotics project** from conception to demonstration.
3.  **Analyze and articulate** the ethical and societal implications of their work.
4.  **Develop strategies for robust, long-term autonomous operation**.
5.  **Present and document** a complex engineering project to a technical audience.

## Topics and Subtopics

### 1. The Capstone Project
- Scoping and project management
- System integration strategies
- Simulation-based testing and validation (e.g., using Isaac Sim or Gazebo)
- The art of a compelling demo

**Why this matters for humanoids**: The capstone project is a dry run for the real-world engineering challenges they will face in their careers.

### 2. Robotics Ethics
- "Asimov's Laws" and their limitations
- Bias in machine learning and its impact on robotics
- The ethics of autonomous decision-making (e.g., trolley problems)
- Job displacement and economic impact

**Why this matters for humanoids**: The creators of this technology have a responsibility to consider its consequences. Ethical failures can be more damaging than technical failures.

### 3. Long-Term Autonomy
- System health monitoring and fault diagnosis
- Lifelong learning and adaptation
- Memory and knowledge representation over time
- Dealing with environmental novelty and uncertainty

**Why this matters for humanoids**: A truly general-purpose humanoid must be able to operate for weeks, months, or years without constant human intervention.

### 4. The Future of Humanoid Robots
- Current state-of-the-art (e.g., Boston Dynamics, Tesla Bot)
- Open problems and grand challenges
- The role of foundation models in robotics
- Speculative futures and their social implications

**Why this matters for humanoids**: It is important to have a vision for the future of the field, both to inspire and to guide responsible innovation.

## Teaching and Learning Activities

### 1. Capstone Project Work (15 hours)
The majority of the module is dedicated to students working on their capstone projects, with instructors providing mentorship and guidance.

### 2. Ethics Debate (3 hours)
Students will be divided into teams and debate a contentious issue in robotics ethics.

### 3. Final Project Presentations (4 hours)
Students will present their capstone projects to the class and a panel of instructors.
