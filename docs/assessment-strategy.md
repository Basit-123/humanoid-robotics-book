# Overall Assessment Strategy

This course employs a **multi-faceted assessment approach** designed to evaluate conceptual understanding, technical skills, creative problem-solving, and ethical reasoning across all aspects of physical AI and humanoid robotics.

## Assessment Philosophy

Our assessment strategy is guided by these principles:

1. **Alignment with learning outcomes**: Every assessment directly evaluates one or more global learning outcomes
2. **Progressive complexity**: Assessments build from foundational to advanced skills across quarters
3. **Authentic tasks**: Assessments mirror real-world challenges faced by robotics engineers and researchers
4. **Formative feedback**: Early and frequent feedback supports learning and improvement
5. **Multiple modalities**: Diverse assessment types accommodate different learning styles and demonstrate varied competencies

**Example topics**:
- Derive the Jacobian for a 7-DOF humanoid arm

---

### 3. Design Challenges (15% of grade)

**Purpose**: Apply creativity and critical thinking to open-ended problems without unique solutions.

**Format**:
- One design challenge per quarter (4 total)
- Propose and justify design choices for specified scenarios
- Written report (5-8 pages) with diagrams and analysis
- Individual work required

**Evaluation criteria**:
- Depth of analysis and trade-off consideration (35%)
- Creativity and originality (25%)
- Technical feasibility and justification (25%)
- Clarity of presentation (15%)

**Example challenges**:
- Design a perception stack for a humanoid operating in a warehouse
- Propose a control architecture for safe human-robot handover tasks
- Develop a learning curriculum for teaching a robot to cook
- Evaluate ethical trade-offs in deploying assistive home robots

---

### 4. Capstone Project (20% of grade)

**Purpose**: Demonstrate integrated mastery by designing, implementing, and evaluating a complete humanoid system.

**Format**:
- Quarter 4 (Module 12) culminating project
- Choose from provided topics or propose your own
- Deliverables:
  - Project proposal (2 pages)
  - Mid-project progress update (presentation)
  - Final implementation (code + simulation/hardware demo)
  - Technical report (10-15 pages)
  - Oral presentation (15 minutes + Q&A)
- Team projects encouraged (2-3 students)

**Evaluation criteria**:
- Technical depth and correctness (30%)
- Integration of multiple course concepts (25%)
- Experimental validation and results (20%)
- Documentation and communication (15%)
- Originality and ambition (10%)

**Example capstone topics**:
- Autonomous humanoid navigation in cluttered indoor environments
- Bimanual manipulation for assembly tasks using imitation learning
- Real-time whole-body teleoperation with haptic feedback
- Multi-robot coordination for collaborative carrying
- Foundation model fine-tuning for physical reasoning

## Grading Breakdown

| Component | Quantity | Individual Weight | Total Weight |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|--------------|
| Problem Sets | 12 | 2.5% each | 30% |
| Coding Projects | 4 | 8.75% each | 35% |
| Design Challenges | 4 | 3.75% each | 15% |
| Capstone Project | 1 | 20% | 20% |
| **Total** | | | **100%** |

---

## Grading Scale

| Grade | Percentage Range | Description |
|-------|------------------|-------------|
| A | 90-100% | Exceptional mastery of all learning outcomes |
| B | 80-89% | Strong understanding with minor gaps |
| C | 70-79% | Adequate understanding with noticeable gaps |
| D | 60-69% | Significant gaps in core concepts |
| F | Below 60% | Insufficient mastery of learning outcomes |

---

## Late Submission Policy

- **Grace period**: 24 hours with no penalty (automatic, no approval needed)
- **Late penalty**: 10% per day (24-hour period) after grace period
- **Maximum late submission**: 5 days; after that, no credit
- **Extensions**: Available for documented emergencies; request at least 48 hours in advance when possible

---

## Collaboration Policy

### Encouraged Collaboration:
- Discussing problem sets at a conceptual level
- Debugging code together (but write your own solution)
- Pair programming on specified coding projects
- Peer review and feedback on written work

### Academic Dishonesty:
- Copying solutions from peers, internet, or previous years
- Using code generation tools (e.g., ChatGPT) without disclosure and understanding
- Submitting work that is not substantially your own
- Violating team project contribution expectations

See [Academic Integrity & Collaboration Policy](./academic-integrity.md) for complete details.

---

## Formative Assessment (Ungraded)

In addition to graded assessments, the course includes:

- **Self-assessment quizzes**: Check your understanding at the end of each module
- **Discussion forums**: Engage with peers on conceptual questions
- **Office hours**: Get feedback on work-in-progress
- **Mid-quarter check-ins**: Reflect on progress and adjust learning strategies

---

## Rubric Philosophy

All assessments include detailed rubrics specifying:

- **Dimensions**: What aspects are being evaluated (e.g., correctness, clarity, creativity)
- **Performance levels**: Exemplary, proficient, developing, inadequate
- **Criteria**: Concrete indicators for each performance level

Rubrics are provided with each assignment and are used consistently for transparent, fair evaluation.
